Lab Overview:

This project includes labs that you can use to gain hands-on experience of building data science solutions. The labs contains few questions that helps you to understand better.

Programming Languages Used in this Course: 

Many of the labs involve writing code in Python. This course does not attempt to teach you exhaustive programming skills and syntax in these languages, so any experience you 
may already have in either language will be useful. However, the labs and demonstrations will provide you with the code you need to perform the data science operations 
described in this project, even if you have no prior experience, and there are references to resources that will help you work with these languages.

Preparing an Environment for the Labs by any of following setup:

1. We will use Jupyter notebooks throughout this project. Anaconda is a combine software for spider, IPython notebook etc. 
   you can install anaconda by following link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

2. Azure Notebooks is a free service that provides Jupyter notebooks along with supporting packages for R, Python and F# as a service. This means you can just login and get going since no 
   installation/setup is necessary.
   You can view notebooks (html render) without logging in. If you want to create/edit/run notebooks, you need to login via any Microsoft ID: you@outlook.com, Xbox.com, etc.
