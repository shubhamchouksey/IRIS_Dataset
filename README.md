# IRIS_Dataset

## Lab1: Introduction to Machine Learning

This lab introduces some basic concepts of machine learning with Python. In this lab you will use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to classify the species of iris flowers, given measurements of flower characteristics.

### By the completion of this lab, you will:

1. Follow and understand a complete end-to-end machine learning process including data exploration, data preparation, modeling, and model evaluation.
2. Develop a basic understanding of the principles of machine learning and associated terminology.
3. Understand the basic process for evaluating machine learning models.
